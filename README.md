## Description
The purpose of this project is divided into two main sections. First, it examines customer and patient review data from social media for Mayo Clinic and Cleveland Clinic. These reviews were collected using Octoparse and visualised in Tableau. In addition, employee evaluations for both clinics were also scraped and analysed to provide insights into internal management. Secondly, Twitter data from both clinics was utilised for sentiment analysis to further understand public perception and engagement. Overall, the study aims to provide a holistic view of customer and employee management at both institutions.

### Introduction
Business process improvement is a growing concern for healthcare organisations around the world, and it is a critical success factor. The goal is to improve organisational performance by redesigning processes or information systems to meet the fundamental needs of today's healthcare organisations (Rebuge & Ferreria, 2012). The advent of social media platform such as social media website, blog posts, forums, and discussion service, online groups, and encyclopaedias, which are frequently referred to collectively, denoted a shift from inactive consumption to active production of various contents from the Internet users (Kotov, 2015). In contrast according to newswire stories, goes beyond presenting facts and reporting events to give a wealth of information about popular opinion on virtually any issue, including healthcare.

The Mayo Clinic and the Cleveland Clinic have once again taken the top and runner-up spots in U.S. News & World Report's annual ranking of the best hospitals in the country (Muoio, 2021). The list is meant to assist patients and clinicians in determining the best options for speciality care or specific treatments. According to Cleveland Clinic CEO Tom Mihaljevic, healthcare is being modernized by new medical personnel alignments, digitalization and personalisation, an emphasis on prevention, and internationalisation. He presented some of the important aspects that have granted Cleveland Clinic top ratings, as well as his vision for the future of healthcare (Resis, 2019). What makes Mayo Clinic Different? It’s Safe, efficient care all in one place. “You will not have to wait weeks or even days for responses. If you have a morning test, your results will be available to your doctor that afternoon”. In fact, most initial visits to the Mayo Clinic last less than a week. “We’ll make certain you receive the tailored attention and particular care you require so you can recuperate faster and return to the things and people you like the most” (Mayo Clinic, n.d.).
This project will use different  methods and visualization tools to analyse Mayo Clinic and Cleveland Clinic social data in detail. Find out what patients and employee reviews in both healthcare. Which healthcare is more suitable? and present the data to assist hospital executives and other in understanding the operational impact of the data.

### Aim of the Analysis
This study aims to evaluate the Customer Relationship Management (CRM) practices of Mayo Clinic and Cleveland Clinic, identifying gaps in their approaches, and to examine the complexities of employee management in healthcare staffing, highlighting its wide-ranging impact on healthcare delivery.

## Conclusion and Recommendation
As this analysis has shown social media may be utilised by parents for health consciousness or by physicians for educating patient as a full source of individual experience. As a virtually infinite source of aggregate data for large scale population studies.

In two parts, the study examines the Mayo Clinic and the Cleveland Clinic. The data were organised qualitatively and statistically based on patient reviews on social media from the analysis of Customer's management. The findings show that Mayo Clinic and Cleveland Clinic both need to improve their Customer Relationship Management (CRM) skills; there is a significant gap in CRM understanding, despite some favourable feedback. The Employees management on the other hand, it implies that the world of health-care staffing is complicated and multifaceted, and that the ramifications of staffing are far-reaching, affecting practically every area of healthcare. Mayo clinic and Cleveland clinic should discover innovative approaches to staffing that will better serve their future, harness experience and ideas from across disciplines, facilities, and locations.

## Limitations
Data scraping from websites was a bit tough during this research, and some sites even disallowed data scraping from their websites. It was also difficult to find a good data scraping tool that could bypass some protocols. Using Python for sentiment analysis was quiet a lot ,because the Twitter API's regulation was delayed, I had to innovate. Healthcare monitoring and analysis systems might certainly benefit from the incorporation of social media-based methodologies. As more individuals utilise social media, communication channels become progressively more scattered, and the risk of distributing false or problematic information grows in accordance.
